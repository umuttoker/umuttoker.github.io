I am the new graduate computer engineer who is living in Ankara. I am currently working with python and it's beautiful micro framework [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).
I am trying to develop some mobile app for android. These days i am playing with graph databases especially [OrienDB](http://orientdb.com/). 
My posts will be related with these technologies. So if you interest with it, you can follow this blog and me. We can learn together all of it :)
